Timmy Turner was walking down the Hauptstrasse when he smelled some bratwurst in the air. 
It was coming from the nearby Biergarten.
He started to head toward the smell, but he was confonted by a hund.
The hund attacked and bit through his lederhose and Timmy started to bleed profusely in the leg. 
Timmy hobbled over and tried to get into his Porsche, but the Schloss was stuck.
As the hund gave chase and Timmy was accepting his fate, his loyal mehlhase came to his defense.
The mehlhase enticed the hund with gebaeck and apfelkuchen calming the dog down.
